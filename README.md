Capstone Project Title: "Stroke Prediction"

The primary objective is to develop an accurate predictive model capable of identifying individuals who are at a heightened risk of suffering from a stroke. 
This comprehensive analysis aims to empower healthcare providers and policymakers to proactively allocate resources, implement targeted interventions, and educate 
high-risk populations, ultimately reducing the incidence and impact of strokes while enhancing public health outcomes.
